## Installation
Installation instructions are currently a work in progress. Feel free to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/7knVjnn) if you have any questions.

## Release
We strongly oppose point release development model and support a rolling release model instead. We will not provide any releases. Please use our `main` branch for a stable version of pCTF.
